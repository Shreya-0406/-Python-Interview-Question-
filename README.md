# -Python-Interview-Question & Answers-
### 1.  Difference between list and Tuple in python?
## List
- List is mutable collection.
- After creating list changes can be done.
- List is created by using square brackets [].
- List occupy more spaces because of mutability.
## Tuple
- Tuple is immutable collection.
- After creating tuple changes cannot be done.
- Tuple is created by using parentheses ().
- Tuple occupy less spaces because of immutability.
## 2. How do set helps in removing duplicates from the list?
- Set does not allows duplicate values or elements.
- Only stores unique values.
- Converting a list into a set automatically removes duplicates.
``` python
list1=[10,20,30,30,40,50]
unique=list(set(list1))
print(unique) #0utput[10,20,30,40,50]
```
## 3. Why are dictionaries faster than lists for lookups?
### Dictionaries
- Dictionaries use a hash table in the background, which gives O(1) time complexity for lookups.
- When you store a key-value pair, the key is passed through a hash function.
- When you do a lookup, the dictionary hashes the key again and jumps directly to the memory location.
### List
- list uses linear search, which gives O(n) linear time for lookups.
- Lists donâ€™t use keys, they store elements in order.
- To find a specific item, Python must check each element one by one.
## 4.How are python strings immutable if they allow operations like replace() ?
- An immutable object cannot be changed after it is created, but operations like replace() creates a new sting.
``` python
name = 'sreeya'
new_name = name.replace("ree","hre")
print(new_name) #output: shreya
```
## 5.How do you merge two dictionaries in python latest version?
- The pipe(|) operator merges the two dictionaries.
- A new dictionary is returned; dict1 and dict2 remain unchanged.
```python
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}

merged = dict1 | dict2
print(merged) #output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
## 6.Explain dictionary comprehension with example?
Dictionary comprehension lets you create a dictionary using a single line of code, using a similar syntax.
``` python
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(squares) #output:{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```
## 7.what are nested dictionaries and how do they you access inner values?
- Nested dictionaries is nothing but adding a dictionary as a value within a dictionary.
``` python
A = {'TEST 1':{'1st_inn':90,'2nd_inn':80},
      'TEST2':{'1st_inn':70,'2nd_inn':100}}
print(A) #output: {'TEST 1': {'1st_inn': 90, '2nd_inn': 80}, 'TEST2': {'1st_inn': 70, '2nd_inn': 100}}
```
## 8.How can you convert the list of tuples in to a dictionary?
- Each tuple in the list is treated as a (key, value) pair.
- The dict() constructor automatically converts the list into a dictionary.
``` Python
list = [('A', 1), ('B', 2)]
dict1 = dict(list)
print("Dictionary:", dict1)
```
## 9.how would you handle missing Key in a dictionary ?
- Use get() or defaultdict
``` python
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

value = my_dict.get("c", 0)
print(value)  # Output: 0
```
## 10.can we use a list as a key in a dictionary? why and why not?
- No, we cannot use a list as a dictionary key in Python because lists are mutable and unhashable.
- Dictionary keys must be immutable and hashable.
## 11.what happens if you try add a mutable object to set?
- A set requires all its elements to be hashable and immutable.
- If we try to add a mutable it gets type error(unhashable type).
## 12.write a code to find common elements in two lists using set operations?
``` python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Convert both lists to sets and use intersection
common_values = set(list1) & set(list2)
print("Common values:", common_values) #output:Common_values: {4, 5}
```
## 13.what is the difference between is and ==for string ? what is the syntax?
| Operator | Compares              | Checks for                              |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `==`     | **Value equality**    | Are the values the same?                |
| `is`     | **Identity equality** | Are they the **same object** in memory? |
``` python
a = "shreya"
b = "shreya"
print(a == b)  # Output: True
print(a is b)  # Output: True
```
## 14.How does sciling works in tuple and string? what are the syntax?
Slicing means extracting a portion  of a string or a tuple based on position.
Both strings and tuples are ordered and indexable, so slicing works the same way for both.
```python
str = "Python"
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(str[2:5])  # Output: "tho"
print(tup[:3])   # Output: (1, 2,3)
```
## 15. How can you reserve a string or list in python using sciling?
- Reverse a string or a list using slicing by using a negative step value.
- To reverse it:
- Start from the end of the sequence.
 - Move backward one item at a time.
 - This creates a reversed version of the original string or list.
  ``` python
 str= "python"
  list = [1, 2, 3]
  print(str[::-1])  # 'nohtyp'
  print(list[::-1])  # [3, 2, 1]
